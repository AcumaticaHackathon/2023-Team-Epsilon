This is the repository for Team Epsilon's Hackathon project that was held on January 28th & 29th at the 2023 Summit at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

### Custom Aware Project

This project will extend the current functionality of Customization Projects Screen, allowing us to Add Author email and phone number, add extra space for notes about the package, add button to review publish details and send an email to authors using Notification Template.
This new information will help support teams to audit and improve the forensic data footprint.
